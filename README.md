README

KITT.js is a project I have been wanting to work on for many years. Howwever, I had never spent enough time honing my programming skills to build this. 

Now I believe my JS + Googling skills are at a sufficient level to take on this project. So welcome to KITT.JS 

The project is named after my first interaction with AI Technology (KITT from Knight Rider)

I am developing KITT in a way that will allow extensibility later on. So in theory to add new functionality a Skill Pack will need to be created but the remainder of the brain.js should remain the same. (This may change in the future) but for now Skills packs should exist in seperate files and be called by Brain.js as and when they are needed.
